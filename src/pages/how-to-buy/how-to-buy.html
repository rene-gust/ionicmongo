  <div class="content">There are a great number of different labels and promises plastered over the many goods brands of coconut oil. Knowing what these brands means can help you select a product that you are looking for. So let's dive into the varies labels you may see:</div>

  <div class="content"><h2>Organic or natural vs. Non-Organic</h2>

  Certified organic or natural coconut oil (always look for the "USDA Organic" label) means that the coconuts which were used for the oil were cultivated without the utilization of pesticides. In most cases this is important whenever choosing a coconut oil. However, there are a few brands that state that they use coconuts that are grown up in more distant locations without pesticides that do not meet the official qualification process. That's where reading brands and performing a little research can save you money without reducing your food benchmarks. In this situation, Google is really your friend.</div>

  <div class="content"><h2>Processed or Refined vs. Unrefined</h2>

  Refined coconut oil has been more processed than unrefined natural oils. The refining process often takes out a lot of the coconut "flavor" and the oil has an increased smoking point making them excellent for cooking foods at higher temperature ranges. But there's a big difference in how coconut oil has been processed, so it is important to learn the terms. Search for coconut oil that uses only chemical-free methods. Including for example natural oils that use friction, some warmth, or rotating/gravity to eliminate the oil from the meat.

  Unrefined  or "Natural" coconut oil is manufactured out of fresh, natural, coconut meat. You will find no added chemicals and high-heat is not used to help expand refine the oil. With this, you will experience more coconut flavour. It includes all medical benefits associated with coconut oil.</div>

  <div class="content"><h2>Virgin vs. Extra Virgin</h2>

  Unlike essential olive oil, there is absolutely no difference between "virgin coconut oil" and "extra virgin coconut oil." You are able to feel assured buying coconut oil that uses either labeling.</div>

  <div class="content"><h2>Centrifuge Extracted Coconut Oil</h2>

  This coconut oil has a light coconut taste... often appreciated by people who eat coconut oil from the spoon. It really is made from newly pressed coconut, chilled and segregated by centrifugal pressure. This coconut oil is considered natural and retains most of its nutrients. It is also usually the priciest coconut oil you will get.</div>

  <div class="content"><h2>Cold Pressed</h2>

  Cold pressed coconut oil is manufactured out of fresh, low temperatures dried coconut flakes. It has a better coconut flavour} and little traces of the soluble constituents extracted from the dried coconut meat. Additionally it is considered "raw" and keeps all its nutrition.</div>

  <div class="content"><h2>Expeller-pressed coconut oil</h2>

  Expeller-pressed is a mechanised extraction process that will not count on solvent ingredients or chemical procedures. They have less coconut flavor than cold-pressed or "raw" coconut oil, and an increased smoking point. This helps it be a great essential oil to utilize for cooking.</div>
