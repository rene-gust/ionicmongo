  <p>Obesity is currently one of the biggest health problems in the world.</p>

  <p>While some people think obesity is only a matter of calories, others (myself included) believe that the sources of those calories are important too.</p>

  <p>It is a fact that different foods affect our bodies and hormones in different ways. In this regard, a calorie is not a calorie.</p>

  <p>The medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) in coconut oil can increase how many calories you burn compared to the same amount of other fats.</p>

  <p>We’ve already mentioned that medium-chain triglycerides go straight to the liver during digestion.  Not only does this give the body an extended energy boost, the processing of MCTs also forms keytone bodies which have the added benefit of reducing hunger and cravings.  It’s easy to see how this can help you lose weight faster.</p>

  <p>Coconut oil enhances the bodies ability to digest food and absorb nutrients so you can eat less without feeling weak or tired all the time.  Also, because it is a natural mood elevator, daily intake of coconut oil can help you to feel less stressed and more motivated to partake in healthy cardiovascular activities which help you to burn off persistent fat stores even faster.</p>

  <p>Regular consumption of coconut oil has the power to ramp up your fat-burning potential – especially for losing stubborn belly fat – improving digestion, regulating appetite, and just making you feel good! Enjoy two to three servings of coconut oil each day to feel fuller faster and kick the habit of snacking on heavy foods between meals.</p>

  <p>Take a tsp. of coconut oil before meals to feel more satiated.  This may be because of the way fats are metabolized in the body. Science has revealed that ketones (that are produced when you consume coconut oil) can lead to increased appetite reducing effects.
